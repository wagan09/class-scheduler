# 🚀 Next.js Project

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/create-next-app).

---

## ✅ Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure the following are already installed on your computer:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (includes `npm`)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

---

## 🛠️ Step-by-Step Setup Guide

### 1. Open Visual Studio Code

- Launch **Visual Studio Code**.
- Open the **Command Palette** (`Ctrl + Shift + P` or `Cmd + Shift + P` on Mac).
- Type and select `Git: Clone`.
- Paste the repository URL:
  ```
  <your-repo-url>
  ```
- Choose a folder to clone the project into.

### 2. Open the Project Folder

Once cloned, VS Code will ask if you want to open the project. Click **Open**.

Alternatively, you can open the folder manually:

- Go to `File > Open Folder...`
- Select the cloned project directory.

### 3. Open a Terminal in VS Code

- Open the integrated terminal by going to `Terminal > New Terminal` from the top menu.

### 4. Install Dependencies

In the terminal, type one of the following depending on your package manager:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn
# or
pnpm install
# or
bun install
```

### 5. Run the Development Server

After the installation is complete, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

### 6. View the Project

Open your browser and go to:  
[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

You should now see your Next.js project running locally.
